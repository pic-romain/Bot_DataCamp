# Bot_DataCamp
My first bot - automation of Daily Pratice answers to gain experience on DataCamp

position at the right of the corner of the validate button

only usable on the main monitor - link to the issue of locateOnScreen on the second monitor

more ellaborated algorithm using the fact that the question are limited and that the questions end up to show up again
other ideas to try : - save all the questions and read the answers
                    - go through the answers but determine how to avoid loops
                    - test this bot on other daily practices
                    - recognize the finish screen to save the results and statistics on the session of xp
